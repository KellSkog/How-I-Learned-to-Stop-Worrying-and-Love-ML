# How to Think About Machine Learning Algorithms
## Introducing Machine Learning
### Recognizing Machine Learning Applications
### Knowing When to Use Machine Learning
### Understanding the Machine Learning Process
ML Problems generally fall into one of these categories
- Classification<br>
e.g. Sentiment analysis and Spam detection
- Regression<br>
e.g. Sales forecasting, stockmaket value
- Clustering<br>
e.g. Customer segmentation
- Recommendation<br>
e.g. Next movie to watch

Data in the form of unstructured text, images or videos requires a meaningful numeric representation, e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 to represend days in a week.

Select an algorithm
- Classification
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Clustering problems are mainly supported by
- K-Means
- Hierarchicical Clustering

Algorithms can usually be utilized in a Plug-and-Play fashion

Data preparation will consume the lion share of project time.

### Identifying the Type of a Machine Learning Problem
- Classification<br>
We have something that can be classified and categories into which to classify:
    - Is this email SPAM or HAM?
    - Is this tweet positive or negative?
    - Will this trading day close up or down?
- Regression
Compute a continusvalue.
    - What will be the price at any given day?
    - How log time will the commute take?
    - What will the sales be of a broduct a future week?
- Clustering
We have a large number of people that we want to find common denominators of
    - Thiefs
    - Fornicators
    - Murderers
- Recommendation
E.g. what kind of artist will this user like aka collaborative filtering.
