### Types of algorithms
1. Supervised Learning
    - Model created from historical data and outcome  
    Predicts future value or category from historic outcome.
        1. Regression
            - Can result in any value e.g. the amount of water to supply to plants.
        1. Classification
            - Can result in a limited set of outputs (Cat, Dog, COBOL coder)
1. Unsupervised learning - Not part of this course!
    - Model created from historical data without outcome  
    Organize data based on characteristics in input data.
        1. Clustering
            - Spots similarities
        1. Association
            - Finds association between variables
        1. Reinforsement
1. Reinforcement learning aka goal oriented - Advanced topic outside this course.  
Adapts to rewards received based on actions changing the state of the environment.
    - Creates agents
    The agents act on the environment and recieves rawards based on outcome  
    and learns to act according to best reward.

### Learning modes
1. Batch
1. Online

### ML Pipeline
1. Problem definition
1. Data sourcing, Preparation & segregation
1. Model training & evaluation
1. Model deployment & monitoring

### Forest Fire Forecast
forestfires.csv  
Predict area burnt by supervised regression learning.  
Require background in linear algebra, statistics and probability.

Google [Colaboratory](https://colab.google/)
> Colab is a hosted Jupyter Notebook service that requires no setup to use and provides free access to computing resources, including GPUs and TPUs. Colab is especially well suited to machine learning, data science, and education.
